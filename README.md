## DontLookUp ( Ideation Stage )
#### Quick Looker 🔍, 🤖LLM based quick search extension, Open-Source Contributions encouraged
---

#### What we want to do ?
- We **dont** want to look up *How Quantum Computers work* (a good read we're sure) while reading a Medium article on *How to Centre a Div*, a 30min side-quest rabbit hole.

#### Basic Idea ?
- A wikipedia style pop-up when hovered over or on selecting a text on a webpage.
- Data returned based on RAG based look-ups or Finetuned LLMs or both.

PS: Ended up calling Gemini Instead 😕
